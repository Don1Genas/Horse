 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
The dream always begins the same.

He’s had it so many times by now, he could recite it by memory if he could get the words to form in his mouth rather than his brain alone. If he could bring himself to speak out loud, to vocalize, to just finally tell it to the world and get it off of his chest.

But he can’t.

And so, the dream begins.

It’s near winter, the end of fall- late, late enough that his breath fogs in the early morning air. He is ten, here. The sky is starting to lighten now, the sun not yet breaching the horizon to the east but starting to, the rays making streaks of gold that dance through the retreating navy, banishing the night once again. Hashirama is standing beside him, shaking in the early morning chill. He never did like the cold; he couldn’t handle it the same way that he could, or the way Mother could. Hashirama whines softly, wanting to go back inside.

Hashirama always whined, even now.

Their father had left the night before, called away late to some important meeting. Kawarama wasn’t back yet. He should have been back. He was seven. He didn’t know anything- he barely knew what flowers he could and couldn’t snack on, what mushrooms would kill you the moment you breathed in their spores and which ones were the best to roast over an open fire. He was seven, so little.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Butsuma approaches, a weird bundle in his arms. Except that isn’t just clothes. Red is staining white, and it’s Kawarama wrapped up in that little bundle, looking too small to possibly be his little brother, but it is. It is him, because he’s sitting up in that bundle and looking at him and telling him “This is your fault. This is your fault. This is your fault.” But he can’t talk. His mouth isn’t moving right, the jaw broken, pried apart by adult hands, broken and hanging loosely, tongue lolling far too long to be normal, but that’s what the tongue is, isn’t it? It goes down the throat. But his eyes aren’t there, even though he can feel him looking, his eyes aren’t there. Instead it’s black holes in his head, but it isn’t black, not really, just a really dark red because that’s muscle and tissue there where his eyes used to be.

Butsuma is talking. “He is a shinobi.” He says. But he wasn’t a shinobi, he was seven. Shinobi were older. They had to be older. Kawarama could barely hold a sword. “He died a shinobi.” Butsuma says again. “He died a shinobi.”

“He died a shinobi.” His brothers repeat. A shinobi. A shinobi. He died. Died. Died. Dead.

The world swirls around him, fading into darkness, and it’s like he’s waking up except he knows he isn’t awake. The ceiling above him isn’t the ceiling in the Senju compound in Konoha, but the thatched ceiling of his childhood. His mother is screaming. He moves before Hashirama does. Or, Hashirama is moving, but he’s moving to pull the blankets up, telling Tobirama he doesn’t want to go, doesn’t want to know. But Tobirama is twelve, and knows more now. He knows what a mourning cry is.

She is kneeling on the ground, clutching the lifeless body of Itama. Itama, who was only nine. Who had been sent out because Butsuma needed Hashirama and Tobirama at home to watch over Mother. Itama, who was stabbed over and over and over and there are too many holes to count from blades. Itama, whose lifeless eyes stare at the sky as Mother howls out a sound that’s not human in any way. Grief, personified; her white hair is wild, blowing in the cold spring wind, whipping it this way and that, and tears are streaking down her pale cheeks, cheeks that hold the same scarlet streaks that his would in four years, but he didn’t know that then.

She is crying, and Hashirama is on the porch, and Butsuma is yelling and he is always yelling, always screaming. The Uchiha did this, the Uchiha massacred his boy, the Uchiha are responsible even though it was his fault for bringing his son onto the battlefield. The Uchiha killed him. Uchiha men killed him. Uchiha men desecrated him.

He didn’t know what that word meant, then. He knows what it means now.

The world swims once more, and as he blinks, he’s staring at scarlet eyes with a peculiar windmill pattern. He blinks, hard. Izuna. He’s pretty, he can’t help but think- a softer face, a smile that was far too cocky for someone like him, far too taunting. He’s holding Tobirama’s shirt, and Tobirama is in a river while Izuna is laughing, trying to run away but the current of the water is pushing him back to Tobirama, and he catches him, and it’s that weird moment when time seems to slow. When everything stops and he just stands with him in his arms and oh.

Wait.

They can’t do this. They step back from one another like they had been burned, Izuna throwing his shirt so quickly and harshly that it smacks him in the face. By the time he grabs it off of his face, Izuna is gone, and he is alone in the river with a smile that’s too big and cheeks that feel too warm and he has to dunk his head into the river when Hashirama suddenly appears, calling for him.

When he rises, he’s not in the river. He’s on a battlefield, the sound of fighting all around. The Uchiha and the Senju. That’s right, that’s this fight. He spins, and finds Izuna, his blade raised, tears in his eyes. Madara is screaming across the field at Hashirama; their fight is flashy and stupid and too big and of course it is, because that’s what Hashirama is. Flashy and stupid and too big for his pants, Mother always said. She’s gone by this time, taken by grief and maybe his father’s hand, they never knew the truth of the matter, only woke one day to find him already burying her.

But Izuna is there, his hair having fallen from it’s tie. The wind rustles it, and he looks so beautiful, even torn up and bloodied and bruised and with dirt smudged across his features. So beautiful, even as he lunges first.

Uchiha were so fucking devoted to their clan, it confused Tobirama sometimes. He’d do anything for Hashirama, sure, but not for his father. Not for his other clansmen, who were lying in heaps, dead or dying or maybe trying to hide beneath all those bodies, hoping to get away from this fighting once and for all. He can’t blame them. He isn’t sure what he’s devoted to, now.

Izuna’s blade crashes with his own. They aren’t using Jutsu- Izuna’s chakra reserves were too low, and Tobirama couldn’t risk signing right now, not with Izuna coming at him over and over and telling him to just give up, to just let him do this, to just die already, you stupid fucking albino Senju. That catches him off guard, he even laughs as Izuna goes in and gets him across the top of his left thigh.

Going for an artery and just barely missing.

He can’t remember what happens next, even in this night terror he can’t piece it together. It’s so many flashes all at once of skin, of laughter, of those crimson eyes with those pinwheels, of heat, of heartache, of funerals, of Hashirama laughing, of Madara laughing, of feeling weightless, of the feeling of someone atop him, of holding someone in his arms, someone with black hair and pale skin and then-

Then, he is holding him in his arms, except this time it’s Izuna’s blood on Tobirama’s blade, and Izuna’s head in his lap as he smiles up at him, as Tobirama apologizes for things having to end this way. As tears fall from his eyes and onto Izuna’s pale cheeks, as Izuna closes his eyes, as Tobirama does not let out a mourning cry but instead lifts Izuna’s body and carries him to where Madara and Hashirama are fighting.

As he feels hands, actual hands touching his actual face, and he’s awake, jolting upright on the futon, gasping for breath and looking around for the phantom hands. The bedroom is empty, the sky moonless. He reaches over and grabs a candle from beside his bed and lights it with a wave of his hand. Nothing sits in the corners waiting to reach out and take revenge, nothing sits at the top of his futon, stroking his cheeks as he struggles through another night terror, nothing lays beside him, onyx hair spread out across pale sheets.

Nothing.

Alone.

His penance.

He breathes a sigh of relief and closes his eyes, shoulders slumping as if he were Atlas and he, alone, held the weight of the world. A shake of the head, and he reaches up to snuff out the flame, never blow it out. No, that was an insult to the spirits, always has been, always will be. Mother taught him that.

He lays back down, eyes falling closed, but for a hint of a moment, he thought he saw scarlet above his head, gazing down at him.

A trick of the light, Tobirama thinks as sleep pulls him back under quickly. Exhaustion does that to a man when you have to go behind and fix every single mistake your brother makes and make sure that the village doesn’t fall apart while he’s in office.

A trick of the light, even as the shadows begin to move.</div>

    <img alt="Tumblr media" class="block w-full mx-auto" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f154ccc57cb80b96b31d3d3b4e69c4b7/df151d600370c030-2c/s250x250_c1/39abfbf15cc2ecb4e587367e0c685e3a47ff3801.jpg" />
  
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">You could feel his eyes on you as you floated on your back- the sun was beating down on your front, the rays feeling uncomfortable, the burn becoming too much. John B was watching you, his handsome features compiled into a frown; plump lips pouting, thick brows pulled down and together, eyes narrowed and focused solely on you. You couldn’t tell if his gaze caused your body to overheat or if it was in fact the harsh sun glaring down on you all. You wriggled from JJ’s grasp, ducking yourself under the surface of the cool water- hoping to ease the burning of your body; you hoped your skin wasn’t going to be reddened from the sun too badly- that would really screw up the tan you had been working on the last few days.  Paddling under the water- letting it flow over your body, arms pulling you through as you glided through it- the feeling of it smoothing over you almost tickled. Your eyes closed and you let your breath leave you in small bubbles that rose to the surface. When you resurfaced, John B was in front of you- grinning as you bobbed back to your feet. His fingers gripped onto your waist, tugging you to him- his other hand lifted one of your arms to drape around his neck and shoulders- he then lifted his hand to brush the salty water from your face and grinned at you.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Hey there..” He murmured, his eyes shining in the sunlight above- droplets of water rolling from his soaked hair as it stuck to his forehead. You smiled, suddenly feeling shy- you could feel the blush decorate your cheeks as you stared into gaze, it felt like you were staring into eachothers souls. You felt like you couldn’t look away- he was drawing you in, his eyes flickering down slightly from your face, yours copied his actions- watching as he bit into his bottom lip, all you wanted was to surge forwards and connect your lips to his plump and inviting ones. You closed your eyes trying to regain some composure, as you felt yourself leaning in towards him- he did nothing to stop you, just as captivated himself. As you tried to calm your racing heart- a wave of cold water rushed over the pair of you- followed by riotous laughter from your friends. You unwrapped your arm from his broad shoulders and waded over to Kie and Pope who were deeply invested in a splash war. You joined in- smacking your hands against the surface of the water and sending it flying at your friends. Pope forced his hands under the water and forced the water to course over you and Kie- you both spluttered and laughed loudly, locking eyes with the mocha skinned beauty nodding as you both launched yourselves at the unsuspecting Heyward boy. Each of you griping onto his shoulders and dunking him under the water with your combined weight- as he went down you both high fived and laughed loudly- your stomachs beginning to ache. Your laugher turned into squeals as you were wrapped up in someone’s arms; one around your waist the other under your knees as you scrunched your body in surprise- you could feel yourself being lifted out of the water and then nothing as you were thrown into the air and collided with the water again quickly sinking beneath it.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Surfacing once more you looked to Kiara who was in a similar position. Pope had long since resurfaced and was high-fiving JJ and John B as they all laughed; Kie and you shared a smile before assaulting the three boys with wave after wave of water as you both madly waved your hands through the water. Laughs, splutters and splashed echoed around the marsh as the five of you soaked each other. Pope dove at you, gripping your waist and dunking himself under the water, before sitting you on his shoulders and standing back up- with you positioned safely, hands resting on the tops of your thighs as you laughed, Pope was challenging the rest of the group. Kie screamed lightly as she was pulled upon JJ’s shoulders and he advanced on you and Pope. You raised an eyebrow challengingly at JJ and Kie- you girls locked hands, as the boys stepped closer to, when you were both finally in the prime position you locked your hands on each others shoulders, all the while laughing. You looked to John B who was stood watching and acting as a referee.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“On the count of three…I take on the winner… Three…” John B shouted his hands cupping around his mouth- making his voice echo as if speaking into a microphone.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Two..” He grinned at you- making your stomach flip.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“One!!” John B yelled, and you began playfully shoving at Kiara as she did the same- you both wrestled for a few moments, you laughed loudly- trying to gain the upper hand and shove her into the water below. While you and Kie were locked in a battle and giggling madly, JJ and Pope were straining to keep you both upright. John B hollered encouragement to the pair of you and whooped, cheering. You had to admit, Kie was harder to beat than you thought she would be; for being all about peace, love and a pacifist- she was scrappy. She shoved and pushed at you, chortling loudly as Pope nearly stumbled backwards- you smirked at her and pushed back at her, she flailed for a moment and JJ stumbled beneath her until she tumbled off his shoulders and sploshed into the marshy water. JJ flopped backwards, before coming back up- he lifted his hands and dragged his wet, darkened hair back away from his face- rivulets of water cascading down his delicious body, and you swore it was as if he was moving in slow motion, like a scene from a movie. When he was satisfied his hair was away from his cheeky face, he sent you a wink as he knew you had been staring- you shook your head and looked away, spotting John B making his was over to you all as Kie popped back up.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Pope whooped and jumped with you still on his strong shoulders, lifting his fingers from where they had been splayed on your thighs- when his fingers let go, you slipped from his shoulders arms windmilling to try and regain some balance but failing as you back slapped into the water. Salted water stinging your eyes and staining you lips with its taste as you brushed hair from your face. You swam closer to the group, arms latching around Pope’s shoulders as you plopped a peck to his cheek.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“You up for a death match Y/N?” John B called out as he was grabbing JJ round his shoulders and dunking him underwater. Pope slid from your arms and flicked your knees over his shoulders once more.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Bring it Routledge!” He called out cockily, watching as John B piled on top of JJ’s shoulders when he had righted himself. Much like before- the pair of you locked hands together and to each others shoulders- JJ and Pope below situating themselves as Kie called out for the battle royale to commence. John B was a tougher opponent than Kiara; where she was a giggling, scrappy mess. John B was staring you down, smirking at you and tugging you closer towards him. One of his hands slipped from your shoulder up to your jaw and stroked a thumb across it delicately- the gentle touch distracting you just enough for him to pull you to the side as you both dropped to the marsh. Once under the water, he tugged you towards him and let his lips meet yours in a secret kiss. Lips caressing your own, the plumpness slipping against your own. He let your lips slip away from his as he dragged you to the surface, gripping one arm around your waist and the other under your knees- you let an arm wrap around his shoulders as he held you up from the water. You could feel a blush warming your cheeks, as you hoped none of the others had seen the watery smooch. Kie paddled to the ladder and pulled herself from the water; Pope and JJ following each muttering about getting a drink or lighting up respectively. John B looked down at you and nudged his nose against your hair, as he waded through the water, you still held against his warm chest. It was only when the pair of you made it to the ladder did he let you go, his hands helping you up the ladder- his large hands finding their way to your ass, they cupped and squeezed as you climbed up the ladder; when you looked back he laughed and shrugged his shoulders not really caring for your shocked expression. You made it on to the boat, and sighed as the summer breeze kissed against you- it cooling the sopping shorts clinging to your hips, you groaned as water flooded from your soaked converse when you took a step.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Your hands strayed to the button of your shorts and popped it open, before reaching down and tugging on the wet laces of your shoes- tugging them off before working on the cut offs still adorning you. Your thumbs dug into the waist band of the shorts and tried to pry them off, pushing them roughly down you hips and butt. The wet material clinging to your equally wet skin- making it harder to try and disrobe yourself. JJ was laughing as you struggled, he felt rather proud of himself as you became as frustrated with the fabric as he had earlier- even though it was his fault they were clinging to you so tightly. You cheered when you finally tugged the irritating fabric from your now sore legs- Kie patted your shoulder and held out her other hand for the shorts you’d kicked away from you, you picked them up and handed them to her, she moved to the other end of the Pogue and laid your clothes out to soak up some sun and dry off, before moving to the benches and sitting herself on one, making grabby hands to you. Shaking your head you moved towards her, but you were stopped by hands tracing up your arm from wrist to elbow making the goose bumps- that had already been forming from the summer breeze- rise more, you looked over your shoulder as John B held out his floral shirt for you to shrug on with his help, which you did gratefully. You let the fabric swamp you, letting the warmth and scent of him surround you, smiling gratefully at him he pressed a kiss to the crown of your head.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“You look good wearing my clothes…” he whispered softly into your drenched hair. You but your lip and pretended not to be affected by his repeated words. His hands clenched the loose fabric on your hips tightly before letting go. You moved towards Kie again, she patted the bench in between her legs, gesturing for you to sit there- John B took it upon himself to plop down in front of her, perching on the deck and then tugged on your fingers- guiding you to sit on his lap. Kie tutted, she had wanted to braid your hair so it dried in waves similar to hers; you always complimented her hair saying how jealous you were of it, so she had decided to style you hair for you, John B being weird and clingy would make it slightly more difficult for her to reach your locks, but she would deal. She gently began to untangle your hair and weave it into the braids, her eyes fluttering around the group as she continued her work absentmindedly; she watched as Pope scrolled through her phone finding a playlist and letting the music flow through the blutooth speakers- nodding his head in time to the beat, a gentle smile on his handsome face. JJ on the other hand was puffing away on a joint- eyes focused on where , you and John B sat between her legs; his expression unreadable as his brows furrowed slightly- Kie could feel her own eyes wander to where you both sat.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">John B was wrapped around you, his fingers twisting the hair Kie was not braiding herself- he was trying to copy her movements you could tell- but he was making a real mess of it. You giggled and pulled his hands away from your salted locks, not wanting it to be too tangled for Kie to work through- his fingers drifted away from the tresses to play with your own fingers. The tips of his tapping against your own, his palms meeting yours as he measured your much smaller ones against his calloused ones. He twiddled with your finger tips, tickling the spaces in between them before tucking his own and linking your hands together. Waving your joined hands in time to the music playing from the speakers. Kie’s fingers continued to work through your hair until it was braided and she tied it off with the spare hair ties wrapped around your wrists amidst the array of woven and puka shell bracelets- when she was pleased with her work, she tugged your hands away from John B and pulled you to your feet. She lead you in a dance, her hips coaxing yours to sway in time to the music; Pope soon joined, sandwiching Kie between you, his head poking over her shoulder as her hands and arms wound around his neck, pulling him closer, so his body was pulled flush against hers- and hers in turn pressed against your own. Pope sang to song quietly- whereas Kie and yourself snag loudly and unabashedly.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">You were enjoying the dwindling sunlight, dancing and singing, sipping on beer and taking the occasional puff from JJ’s blunt. The entire time, a set of hazel eyes watched your every move; every sway of your hips, every flick of your braids, every giggle, every smile. He watched the way you would dramatically hold an invisible microphone to your lips before turning and offering it to JJ and himself. JJ joining in occasionally playing the air guitar. John B pulled you away from Pope and Kie, hands gripping and tickling your waist as he coaxed you to spin- loving the sound of your laughter as it echoed throughout the marsh. But alas the summer sun, couldn’t stay high in the sky and it began to sink lower in the sky; telling you all that your fun in the marsh was drawing to a close, at least for today. JJ moved towards the wheel and gestured for someone to pull the anchor; Pope grudgingly obliging, and once the heavy object was stowed correctly, you were all on the move. You moved to the bow and sat- legs dangling over the edge, John B following and perching behind you- his legs pressed against your outer thighs arms wrapping around you as his shirtless chest pressed to your back, his face nuzzling into the crook of your neck- his lips surreptitiously pecking at the column of your neck. Causing a wave of heat to trickle down your body and settle between your legs.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Can I show you something tonight?” He murmured into your neck, there was a tone in his voice that made a shiver run down you spine. He smiled against your skin and squeezed his arms around you tighter as you whispered back a ‘Yes’- your mouth going dry, it felt like between them; him and JJ, they were trying to squeeze every last orgasm from your body. And part of you was excited, but another part of you wondered just how much you could take.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">You had noticed he seemed to be more clingy and desperate to touch you today- and you struggled to find an issue with that. You felt content with his arms wrapped around you- his lips doing sinful things to your neck- definitely leaving more of his marks there. Soon enough you were all docking outside the chateau, the sky turning a dusky pink- the cicadas chirruping loudly as you all began to disembark the Pogue. You’d grabbed your shoes, shorts and abandoned top- the bottom half of your outfit still damp, and were preparing to climb up to the dock yourself when John B turned and pulled you up and out of the boat. He set you on your feet on the dock; before turning and tapping on his back. You smiled and climbed aboard- clinging to him like a koala.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">He turned his head and smiled at you over his shoulder, eyes sparkling mischievously, you smiled back and kissed the corner of his lips- he followed your friends into the ramshackle building you all thought of as your home. He traipsed you both into to main lounge area and dropped onto the pullout; you huffed out as his weight crushed you in to the back of the well worn couch. The others flopped around you; as you realised John B wasn’t going to be moving any time soon, you resigned yourself to being his seat, keeping your arms and legs wrapped around him, clinging like a baby monkey. Soon enough Kie was pulling her phone and portable projector from her bag and flicking through to the Netflix app, beginning a film you all agreed might not be too lame. The group of five sitting quietly watching the film- until something ridiculous happened and there was uproar; shouts and wild gestures happening towards where the film was being projected. You sighed, wriggling under the weight pressing into you- you weren’t interested in the movie any longer, but you desperately wanted a shower. The sunscreen and salt was clinging to your skin making it feel sticky. You traced your fingers along the toned muscles of John B’s abs, they flexed against the tips of your fingers at the ticklish sensation. You began tracing nonsensical shapes and words along his skin- your fingers ghosting over his steadily warming skin, you could feel his breathing deepen as he shifted and wiggled on top of you. You bit your lip and acted on instinct- not giving yourself a second to second-guess your actions; you let your finger trail from the middle of his chest, then going lower on his stomach- his abs flexing and clenching in your fingers wake, your fingers found the edge of his swim trunks and traced along it carefully. The tips trailing from one side of the v of his hips to the other and back again.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Stop teasing…” he whispered into your neck- his words kissing against your skin. As you tried not to smirk- you were affecting him, like he usually did you- and you were fucking revelling in it!</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“I’m going to shower off the day… rather than die of boredom watching this shit..” You murmured to the group as you managed to push John B from you and in to the space you had vacated- the others gave non-committal answers as you tiptoed from the room and towards the bathroom. You stopped off in JB’s room grabbing another of his shirts; this one a soft cotton button down- the stripey print bright- you brought it to your nose and sniffed in the scent, as you remembered having his scent engulf you in other situations. A shiver ran down your spine as the memories flooded your brain; his lips, hands, tongue and teeth all over you as he ground you down on him. Then you remembered the feeling of JJ’s cool metal rings biting into you delicate skin this afternoon. Your mind was flooded with images of both boys reaching completion as the feeling of warmth swirled in your system, a heated ache settling between your legs. You could hear the groans of JJ and John B echoing through your mind and before you could really comprehend it- your hand was buried in your bikini bottoms, fingers dipping to your entrance to gather some of your slick before rubbing against the sensitive nub. Your fingers circled it, drew figure of eights on it and brushed it again and again- quiet moans leaving your lips as the pleasure grew and grew, you gasped as a shock of pleasure coursed through you. But froze as you heard the door open and close behind you- you then felt a pair of now familiar lips descend on your neck. Turning your head to face him over your shoulder- his plump lips landed on your own and began to devour you. You moaned in to him as the juncture between your legs throbbed- demanding attention.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Let me help you?” John B whispered against your lips, all you could do was nod as his hands trailed over your body- his hands cupped one of your breasts and you relaxed against him legs becoming weak as his fingers stroked over and then began flicking, tweaking, tugging and pinching the hardened peak. His other hand ventured in to your bikini bottoms and followed your lead- collecting some of your wetness and rubbing against your pulsing nub. He began to take steps towards the bed as your knees buckled- a chuckle leaving his lips as your weight fell against him and a moan was dragged from your lips. His slow steps pushed you towards the bed, and when you were at the foot of it- he gripped your waist and much like earlier on in the day, he tossed you threw the air and you bounced on the bed, flipping over so you could look towards his beautiful face, a giggle leaving you. He stepped closer, looking like a predator- your body reacting in a surprising way as you felt a rush of exhilaration flood through your body. He stepped towards the bed- his torso heaving as he breathed heavily- it was then your realised your own breathing was far from calm. He kneeled on the end of the bed, one of his hands grasping at your ankle and tugging you towards him- a small squeal leaving you- which he attempted to shush with his lips as he kissed you feverishly. His hands continued to tug until your legs were resting on the outside of his knees as he balanced there.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Remember how I asked if I could show you something… well can I?” he asked huskily- voice deepened and making you feel a certain type of way. You nodded- voice failing you- but your head bibbed up and down emphatically. He grinned down at you- soft cushiony lips pulling back to reveal his pearly whites. He then set those lips to work; cascading down your cheeks and lips, and further down your neck- nibbling at the juncture where your shoulder met the deliciously bruised column. His hungry lips mouth at the collar of his floral shirt- it getting in his way, so he moved on. Lips chasing down your clavicle until it met the hardened peak of your nipple- pressing through the fabric, vying for his attention- and he gave into its wishes, worshipping it as his tongue lapped at it though the fabric- straining for more. But that wasn’t the only area in need of his ministrations your lower and more intimate area ached and throbbed for something- a graze of a hand or at least now friction of some kind- you were beginning to feel rather neglected in that particular area and I was nearly driving you to madness. Or that could have been the truly sinful way his lips were cherishing your body. Your moans were quiet and desperate- making you feel almost pathetic as he revelled in the sounds as they reverberated through him.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Soon he grew tired of the fabric hiding you from him- he wanted, not needed to see you. To look upon you and etch this scene into his brain; you panting below him without abandon craving his touch and eagerly anticipating his next move. His deft fingers worked the buttons through their holes hurriedly- helping you to shrug off his shirt- leaving you in the bikini from earlier, the scrapes of fabric were something he was beginning to detest as his fingers toyed with the strings holding it to cover your chest. You nodded eagerly as he looked to you for permission- and once it was given the tugged and pulled until your breast fell free; and all he could do was marvel at you. Chest heaving- nipples ruddy and hardened- a flush decorating you, and good god! You looked like a piece of fine art to him. Not being able to hold back- he was on you again, your hands caressing his back and head- tugging on the long brunette locks as his lips kissed yours harshly. His fingers travelled down you body, ghosting over your stomach and copying your earlier actions- trailing over the edge of your bottoms, causing your hips to stutter and lift hoping for some relief. He chuckled lowly as his lips followed the course his fingers took- causing sparks to ignite within you, his body scooched down until only his torso was resting on the bed- your legs cradling his shoulders as his hazel gaze looked to you questioningly. Your bottom lip caught between your teeth and you felt like you were watching the scene unfold from out of your body. Your mind clouded with lust, but you knew you wanted him to do something- anything, you’d asked for this when you asked him to teach you- but the niggling feeling of self-doubt nudged at you. Suddenly making you feel self-conscious; as you lay there nearly bare before his hungry eyes. John B sat back on his feet as he took in your hesitation- he moved over you once more and stroked at your face- brushing the baby hairs away before dropping a kiss to your forehead.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Remember the rules; what you say goes, you say the word and we stop..” John B whispered, ducking his head to look in to your mesmerising eyes. And that was all it took- him giving you the control, handing the reins to you, and you needed him to continue what he had been doing previously. You pushed yourself up- lips pressing against his in a assuring kiss.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Show me…” You whispered into his mouth. His smile was obvious as he continued to kiss you before letting his lips wander south. He tugged the bottoms from your hips- you lifting them to help him- he tugged them down your legs and tossed them to the floor uncaring where they landed. As you lay bare completely before him- your legs moved to close yourself off from his gaze; as it locked on your most intimate area, which was glistening enticingly at him, his hands held your legs in place as his face hovered over you. Your breath hitching as he finally made contact. First he licked a testing stripe along your lower lips, waiting for your reaction and a high pitched keen was his reward. He then dove in- tongue tasting you- licking and caressing you the way his lips had done elsewhere. Your breathing continued in a stuttered manner as he focused his efforts on your abandoned nub; his lips closing around it and suckling gently making you whine. The sparks from before had caught and now there was a raging fire burning within you. As the sounds left your lips, they sounded like the sweetest melody in his ears- but he knew the rest of your friends were in the next room, and he didn’t want to share this with them. He pulled back, a finger going to his smiling lips as he shushed you.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“You’ve gotta be quiet baby girl… the others can’t hear you…” he muttered against the skin of your soft thighs, you just nodded and held a hand over your mouth to stifle the sounds of your pleasure. He then went back to work, lips and tongue working you, pushing you closer to the edge of ecstasy- the fire raging becoming all encompassing. One of his hands ghosted up your leg and joined him buried between them with his mouth. It pumped in and out of your drenched entrance slowly as his lips closed around your nub once more. He suckled on it, drawing your orgasm closer to you- he groaned in to you. The vibrations sending you over the edge- as you crumbled around him, legs going numb and squeezing shut on the sides of his face all at the same time- face still buried in your core- as his tongue and fingers continued to work you through it. As your orgasm washed over you- you bit down on your hand to stop from calling out loudly. Once you had stopped quivering around his finger and your clit had stopped pulsing he pulled away- his lips and chin glistening in the low light from the glowing moon outside his window. You watched as his tongue darted out and licked your essence from them before lifting his hand and wiping his chin on the back of it. He then crawled up the bed and pulled you with him- tucking you into his side, making your head rest on his chest.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“How was that?” he asked, a small almost nervous smile on his swollen lips. You blushed, pushing your face further into him before speaking up.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">“Amazing thank you…” you whispered, your eyes trailing his body looking towards his shorts. He looked down to you when you shifted- his gaze following yours, and now it was his turn to blush. He revealed that while he had been devouring you like you were the sweetest dessert, he had taken matters into his own hands simultaneously, making a mess in his shorts, but he didn’t really mind all that much; seeing you come undone had nearly been enough for him, but the added touch of his hand as he made you see stars made him leap over the precipice with you. And now you were both sated, he could shower in the morning, as all he wanted to do was fall asleep with you in his arms.</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">And that was what he did.</div>

    <div class="p-3">Jalen should’ve taken into account why Ja didn’t wanna do the dunk contest. Like saying Jalen can’t dunk when that boy did a 360 between the legs 😭 Just for perspective, Vince Carter only did a 360 windmill and ppl lost it. It’s fine to say he sucked by taking too many attempts and that nft stuff but saying he can’t dunk is just hate frfr. Ppl aren’t satisfied, commentators are too negative, and judges are bias. It’s stale and too political now. The fun has been sucked out of it </div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">yup and all integrity was lost over the past few years when the judges robbed certain participants but i think the final straw was wade and gordon. sorry but after that i wouldn’t take the competition seriously either. it might be hard going forward getting real stars to wanna participate so good luck to the nba but they did it to themselves. &amp; yeah with jalen let’s be honest people’s hate for him goes beyond basketball as well and it’s weird </div>

    <div class="p-3">second of all since u seem to have not seen this can u answer is this giannis in giannis marcus!!! also what pairing do u think would fit a knight/squire/don quixote AU the best? </div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">YO!!! YEAH! IT&#39;S TOTALLY GIANNIS IN GIANNIS MARCUS LMAO it&#39;s so cute you thought of them!!!!! It makes me think of like... them in the kitchen and giannis, after seven failed attempts smothering his accent&#39;s thickness, finally gets Google to play a slower one direction song for them to dance to. He leans down and bows all fancy as he raises Marcus&#39;s hand to his lips and gives it a gentle little kiss. Then he leads him away from the table so they can slow dance around their table top island. Use a carrot as a pretend microphone as they serenade each other LMAO</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Don quixote... I&#39;m PRETTY sure I remember reading like.. a kids book on the knight and the squire when I was like. A fetus... hmm I didn&#39;t really translate it all that well tho but im??? Pretty sure it&#39;s about this delusional dude recruiting this?? Guy named Sancho, who was a peasant or something, to go out on some kinda? Mission with him? And the knight kept coming across normal things like a windmill and going like &quot;AHA! A GIANT!!!&quot; Or &quot;LOOK!A CASTLE!!&quot; And it&#39;s just a pile of shit or smthin... and Sancho like? Knew it was a pile of shit but he kinda went along with it anyways? Cus he a real homie. And he likes being a squire ?? Bcus it&#39;ll help his status into becoming like??  A governor or smthin idk it&#39;s been a WHILE lmao. </div>

    <div class="p-3">But the ending is pretty sad .. I think?? The knight like. Gets disillusioned and dies and Sancho is stuck dreaming so they kinda switch roles? Idk I just know it&#39;s sad</div>

    <div class="p-3">THATS AN INTERESTING AU!!! hm... idk really! It&#39;s a very? Specific kinda trope! Like one is an idealist and the other is a realist but one ends up disheartened while the other becomes a believer? </div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">Maybe Chris paul and Blake griffin? Blake griffin as the knight and cp3 as the squire. Blake starts off as this terrific dunking prodigy who&#39;s just super talented and has dreams for a bigger, brighter, flashier future while cp3 is just like &quot;man. I just want a ring bro&quot; but then they switch roles with cp3 being the big finals star with his head in the clouds and Blake just becomes a background guy for the nets who didn&#39;t make the finals? </div>

    <div class="p-3">That or either John and trae! With trae being this whole showoff and john being the politer public speaker. But then trae gets injured and john has to be the hawks dude??? Idk! The knight/squire is a very intriguing dynamic! </div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3"></div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">It could also be 2jays? Jaylen starting off as a confident star with jayson as his adoring but quieter best friend? But jaylen gets injured while jayson has to play in the Olympics. Jaylen in all his depression fits while jayson has like... hot girl summer Olympics LMAO idk!!!</div>
  
        
        
        
      
        
    <div class="p-3">OOR it can also be donny and royce. Donovan, the weapon to jazz&#39;s success, being all determined and confident to lead his team to the finals but ends up losing. Being all mad. Everybody getting worried about him requesting a trade out of the jazz. Royce really wanting him to stay?? Hm!!! Interesting indeed!</div>
