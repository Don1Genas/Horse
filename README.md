# HORSE 


## Wireferame
This is a wireframe of the layout I intend to have on my game of HORSE.
<https://wireframe.cc/9VDwuR>

### Explanation(s) of specific Technologies 
1. Upon entering the game a prompt will be given.
..* One player or two?
..* if one player, then that player will play against the computer.
2. Then there will be a coin flip to see who goes first. (Heads win)
3. Player will have a choice of shot(s) to take from a drop down box.
..* choices are: **Dunk_** (windmill, 360 degree, under the leg), 
     **jumpshot from left, right or top of key_** (3 pointer, off the glass, left hand, swish..nothing but net), **Trick_** shot (behind the backboard, eyes closed)
**Dunks have a 33% chance of being made, all others have a 25% chance**
4. If a shot is made followed by a miss by the opponent, the opponent gets a letter...starting with H and the O, etc. the first player to spell HORSE, loses.
5. A winner will be declared and a prompt will be given asking if the player would like to play again.

### Approach Taken
1. create a grid-template-area that reflects my wireframe in css
